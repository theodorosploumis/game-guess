![](assets/logo.svg)

## About
- An educational printable, board game based on maths, logic and imagination.
- Players: 2 \- 4.
- Age: 8+
- Mechanics: procedural thinking, logic, maths
- Difficulty: from 2/5 to 5/5 depending on the Action and the age of the Players.

## Assets
- All assets are made for A4 sheet printing. Just open a generator page (Board, Tokens or Cards) and print the webpage in A4 size with no margins.
- Board. One or more boards (you can have as many boards as you want). A Board is randomly generated and contains equal size Cells.
  Each Cell may be a number (0 \- 99) and/or a letter (A-Z) that is printed on a colored background. Examples [here](boards).
- Playing Cards. 50 Cards each one with its own Action. Examples [here](cards).
- Player Tokens. Each Player has 9 tokens. Examples [here](tokens).

## Rules - Gameplay
- Each Player gets a Card and keeps it until the end of the game.
- Each Card contains an Action. An example of an Action is "Draw a horizontal line on every 3 turns".
- Actions are repeatable. The Player simply needs to represent the Action every time he/she Plays by placing a Token on a Board Cell.
- Every time that a Player has to play his/her Action he places one of his/her tokens on any empty Cell. 
  After all the 9 Tokens are placed on the Board he/she gets back the first 6 Tokens.
- If a Player cannot play the Action (eg there are no Cells left to play) he/she must say "No Action available". 
  Then a new Board can be set below the first one ond so on. Previous Boards remain on the table until they have no Tokens on them.
- Every 3 turns a Player can guess the other (or previous if there are more than 2 Players) Player Action.
- If the Player guesses correct the opponents Action on the fist 3 turns she/he gets 3 Points, 
  if guesses on the first 6 turns he gets 2 and for guesses over 6 turns (9, 12, 15 etc) he/she gets 1 point.
- The game ends when there is a correct guess.
- If no Player can guess any Action after 15 turns the Players can change Cards and start with a new Action.

Advanced Game options:

- Players get 2 Cards and play their Actions as they want (eg they can always play the first Action or play the fist 
  Action for 3 turns and then the second Action etc)
- 6 Boards are placed on the table in 3 columns and 3 rows.
- Each Player plays his/her Action for 6 times and then the next one.
